						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">As a research based start-up, we’ve had a long and difficult journey but are incredibly excited about where we’ve been able to bring Voltera over the past year and a half.</p>
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">We’re electrical engineers building tools for other electrical engineers, but QEC made us realize that anyone could not only understand our product, but also understand the potential it has for changing the technologies we all use everyday.</p>
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">The first half of 2014 was spent in R&D… developing the chemistry, iterating the product, and engaging with customers. In July, we moved to Shenzhen, China as part of a hardware start-up accelerator program.</p>

					<div class=" [ col-md-6 content ] ">
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">For almost 4 months we focused on new challenges like supply chain, manufacturing, and shipping. We’ve never hid from big problems before and these were amongst the most interesting we’ve ever tackled.</p>
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">We’re launching the product very soon and we know 2015 is going to be huge!</p>
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">-Alroy Almeida, Co-founder of Voltera</p>
						<p class=" [ content__bullet ] ">Update: Since placing second at the Queen’s Entrepreneur’s Competition, Voltera went on to host a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show.
